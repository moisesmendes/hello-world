# Version Controlling a Plain Text Document

Version control systems like Git work best with plain text files. Plain text files are files with minimal encoding, 
whereas word and other word processors produce a lot of code that is not human readable. The same text saved in a ‘.txt’ 
file opens equally well in Word, LibreOffice or Notepad. This ‘portability’ of plain text files is a major benefit: they 
will open and display the text properly on almost any computer.

Although there are many benefits to writing our documents in plain text files we quickly come across some limitations. 
We may want to emphasise parts of text with italics or with bold words. We may want to include headings or include quotations. 
This is where ‘markdown’ comes in.

Markdown is a way of including formatting into a plain text document. You may have come across HTML or LaTeX in the past. 
These markup languages also express information about the formatting and structure of plain text. Markdown, however, tries 
to minimize the syntax. This makes it easier to focus on the content of writing without the markup getting in the way—hence 
the name ‘markdown.’

The Markdown syntax won’t be covered in this lesson in order to keep the length short. However, it makes sense to explore 
Markdown once you have gone through this lesson and are comfortable with the basics of version control. GitHub integrates 
its own version of Markdown syntax. If you add Markdown syntax to documents you version control with GitHub Desktop these 
will be rendered on the GitHub website. Arguably the best way to learn Markdown is to begin using it. The Getting Started 
with Markdown lesson by Sarah Simpkin provides an overview of Markdown while the lesson Sustainable Authorship in Plain 
Text using Pandoc and Markdown by Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff explains how to utilise Markdown in combination with Pandoc 
to use plain text for your academic writing.
