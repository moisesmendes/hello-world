# Version Controlling a Plain Text Document

Version control systems like Git work best with plain text files. Plain text files are files with minimal encoding, 
whereas word and other word processors produce a lot of code that is not human readable. The same text saved in a ‘.txt’ 
file opens equally well in Word, LibreOffice or Notepad. This ‘portability’ of plain text files is a major benefit: they 
will open and display the text properly on almost any computer.

Although there are many benefits to writing our documents in plain text files we quickly come across some limitations. 
We may want to emphasise parts of text with italics or with bold words. We may want to include headings or include quotations. 
This is where ‘markdown’ comes in.

Markdown is a way of including formatting into a plain text document. You may have come across HTML or LaTeX in the past. 
These markup languages also express information about the formatting and structure of plain text. Markdown, however, tries 
to minimize the syntax. This makes it easier to focus on the content of writing without the markup getting in the way—hence 
the name ‘markdown.’

# Adding something: Text Editors

To write in plain text we want to use a text editor. There are a huge number of free and paid text editors available. Some of these are very straightforward and simple to use while others have a learning curve and potential uses beyond simple text editing. In the long run using a more advanced and extendable text editor like Vim or Emacs may save you time but for now we can start with a simpler editor. Atom is a good option for getting started. Atom is a text editor built by GitHub and includes syntax highlighting for Markdown alongside integration with GitHub. It is free and open source, a full ‘flight manual’, including installation instructions, is available here.
